Tiny Tiny RSS Contributed files
===============================

This repository contains files which had been removed from trunk for
whatever reason (usually it's because I can't properly test their functionality).

Important note:
===============

This isn't a repository for your own stuff you which to contribute (I admit
maybe the name is somewhat misleading) - please use your own git or whatever
repositories and link them on the forums or the wiki. This will make it easier
for you to maintain your code and I won't have to deal with excess pull-requests.
